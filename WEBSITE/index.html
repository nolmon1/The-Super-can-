        A significant number of people around the world struggle with year-round food security, but have excess food in certain parts of the year. Preservation methods exist; however there is not a device used in aid programs that helps ensure consistent food supply for these affected groups. There has also been a proven positive impact on nutrition when education is provided

        The problem of food supply started back when much of southeast Asia was still 
        colonized. Colonizing powers focused on ways to increase the efficiency of crops 
        grown for export but left local food supplies alone for the most part, especially 
        in countries like Sri Lanka and modern-day Bangladesh. This led to a continually 
        lacking food supply throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries (Hazell 67). 
        The Green Revolution in the 1960’s did increase overall yield of crops in southeast 
        Asia, especially of wheat crops, however it benefited the already wealthy farmers the 
        most. The high price and high intensity of agriculture required to keep up with new 
        crops with higher yields prevented lower income farmers from reaping all of the
        benefits and split economic classes further apart (Jacoby, 1972). This led to the
        disparity in economic classes still present in southeast Asia today. This is also 
        why wheat yield has increased more than rice yield, as the intensive production of 
        high yielding varieties of rice takes careful irrigation and direct sunlight, both of 
        which are often not available to poorer farmers. (Farmer 204). Of course, cereals and 
        grains are not the exclusive agricultural product of these areas. Vegetables also 
        play a huge role in the proper nutrition of the local population. There have been 
        multiple proposed cycles of planting vegetables within a family’s property to fulfill
        nutritional requirements, however they often end up being expensive due to having to 
        source many different kinds of seeds.
       <br /> Many people that lack food security lack it due to conflict, which is not the problem 
        this thesis serves to solve. The problem this thesis serves to solve is people suffering 
        from food insecurity due to a lack of a consistent food supply. In some areas, food is 
        plentiful in one part of the year while drought or severe weather makes food scarce in 
        other parts. Most often, this occurs in rural parts of south Asian countries, including 
        Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India (Ferdous et. Al., 2016). Many rural farmers who do not 
        have access to a significant market are unable to make good use of the extra produce 
        they may have.
       <br /> The largest part of this issue is getting enough families to a place where they have a 
        surplus of produce, in order to preserve or sell it. It has been proven that education 
        on proper food preparation decreases malnutrition when markets are widespread and 
        available (Roy et. Al. 323). It is reasonable to assume that with similar education, 
        focused more on growing a wide variety of foods to meet nutritional needs, malnourishment 
        would also be reduced in more rural areas without as much access to markets.
        Solving this issue in a sustainable way is essential to solving the food crisis. 
        Increasing yield from poorer farmers also allows for greater development in south Asian 
        countries, bringing them closer into competition with the rest of the world’s economy. 
        This brings more of the world’s population into development, increasing living conditions. 
        This also serves as an experiment for both the benefits of the preservation of food and how 
        education affects rural agricultural practices.
